# Phone Controlled Robot Arm
Using an Arduino Uno and Servo Motors, the arm can make controlled movements and complete certain tasks within the range of the movements.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting comfortable with Arduino, LEDs, and Servo Motors. Being new to circuitry and coding, it was important to me that before jumping into the project specs, I took a deep dive into the how and why. Starting with Blink, the simplest code which blinks the led on the arduino on and off, I become comfortable with digitalWrite(), learning how to control two outputs (HIGH or LOW) to turn the LED on and off. Once comforable, I then dove into outsourcing the LED. Here using digital pins, I was able to get my first introduction to circutry, spefically Ohm's Law and how to manioulate restisotrs to allow for the correct amount of current. From there, I moved on to  ~PWM pins which generate a steady rectangular wave to allow incrimental results through digital means using, for example the analogWrite() function. Rather than being either on or off, the fucntion can output anywhere from 0 to 255 allowing for a plethora of new possibilties. Among the new possiblites using PWM pins is the abilty to control the brightness of an LED and the rotation of a Servo Motor. Using a for() loop, I correlated two servo motors turn torwards 180 to the brightness of an LED, and its turn back to a corresponding dimming effect, using everything I have learned thus far.
